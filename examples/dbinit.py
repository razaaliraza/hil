"""
Register nodes with HIL.

This is intended to be used as a template for either creating a mock HIL setup
for development or to be modified to register real-life nodes that follow a
particular pattern.

In the example environment for which this module is written, there are 10
nodes which have IPMI interfaces that are sequentially numbered starting with
10.0.0.0, have a username of "ADMIN_USER" and password of "ADMIN_PASSWORD".
The ports are also numbered sequentially and are named following a dell switch
scheme, which have ports that look like "gi1/0/5"

It could be used in an environment similar to the one which
``hil.cfg`` corresponds, though could also be used for development with the
``hil.cfg.dev*``
